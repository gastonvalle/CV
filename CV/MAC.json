      "description": "I help individuals, teams, and organizations to drive their Agile and digital transformation. With a focus on creating great products. Leading the change process through continuous improvement. Making sure we understand all aspects of the changes and bring the best of each individual.\n\nI’m a software engineer with 15+ years of experience in different industries and types of organizations, with a strong technical background and very enthusiastic about team dynamics and people relationships. I have experience in leading teams and make them get the best version of themselves. \n\nAfter almost 9 years I decided to shift my career towards a Scrum Master and Agile Coaching guided by my passion for Agile and mainly the human values that are involved. I love working with people and teams to help them to get the most of them and find new ways of working, perspectives, and mindset.\n\nIn the last few years, I’ve seen that a systemic and organizational approach to change management is a must to enable real agility. That’s why I work at all levels of the change (personal, teams, organizational structure, processes, strategy, leadership, and culture), so the continuous improvement is done organically.",
